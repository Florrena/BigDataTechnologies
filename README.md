**Chosen dataset **

Name: Steam Games Dataset 2025 

Source: kaggle.com/steam-games-dataset-2025  

We are using the games_march2025_full dataset for our main analysis 

We chose the Steam Games dataset because we’re interested in gaming and working with this data makes the project easier and more interesting for us. It has 90k rows and 47 different columns with valuable information like game names, genres pricing and reviews, which gives us a lot of things to analyze and visualize. Since the data is taken from Steam using the Steam API, it is a real-world dataset. 

**Problem statement **

What problem are we solving: What makes a game successful in today’s world? 

Why is the problem important in Big Data context: It’s important because the dataset is complex and handling it requires Big Data tools. Also, figuring out why different games succeed can help developers see what is trending and create more popular games and boost sales. 

**Project objectives **

Key goals for understanding what makes a game successful: 

Identify key trends by analyzing tags, genre, etc. 

Analyze user reviews and recommendations using Spark and MongoDB 

Analyze pricing impact on game sales and/or popularity using Spark and MongoDB 

Possibly comparing success with 2024 dataset, if we have time, to see which trends and games changed over time. 

**Expected outcomes **

We aim to identify what makes a game successful across Spark and MongoDB. 

We aim to identify correlation between user feedback, recommendations and game success. 

We aim to compare the game's success over time. 

We aim to identify key gaming trends on Steam and process them efficiently using Spark and MongoDB.
