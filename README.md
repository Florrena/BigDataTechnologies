This project analyzes game tags to compare their occurrence in successful games. It uses popular Python libraries to process the data and create visual insights.

## Follow these instructions to run the notebook on your local machine.
Make sure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.11.11
- Java JDK version 17
- Apache Spark version 3.5.5
- compatible winutils.exe
You can use the virtual environment to run this code and use Spark, in this case just use 'pip install pyspark' in your virtual environment. Note that you still need to download Java, winutils.exe and python.

Additionaly, you need  MongoDB (local or cloud instance). You can get it from here -> http://mongodb.com/try/download/community

Create a new connection and copy the the connection string.

### Install required Python libraries using pip install:
- pandas 
- numpy 
- matplotlib 
- seaborn 
- scikit-learn
- pymongo 

Then, clone the repository -> https://github.com/Florrena/BigDataTechnologies.git

Download the dataset -> https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/artermiloff/steam-games-dataset (We are using the games_march2025_full dataset for our main analysis)

Put the dataset and repository in the desired place in your local device and run the program.

### ! Make sure to update your MongoDB connection string in the notebook, as well as the dataset path !
